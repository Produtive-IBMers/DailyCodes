**Problem Statement:**

Today, it's all the world of Cryptography. In every prestigious coding competition there will be atleast one question on Cryptography. So as our's :P

Cryptography is a combination of Cryptology and Cryptanalysis. Cryptology deals with encryption and decryption of messages. Cryptanalysis deals with analysing how message is encrypted and cracking the logic of encryption to decrypt it. At this instant you should play the role of cryptanalyser of VIIT ;P Your task is to analyse the given messages and crack the logic or pattern behind it, then write a code to decrypt it. Analyse the below inputs.

**Hint:**
First think how they are encrypted and then go for decryption.

hello -----------> leolh

hacker --------------> rkaech

think ----------------> nhkit

twice ----------------> cweit

algorithm ----------> hiolmtrga

aaaabbbb ----------> bbaabbaa

**Input:**

First line consists of integer T representing the number of testcases
Next T lines consists of a string S which should be decrypted

**Output:**

Print T decrypted strings in each line.

**Constraints:**

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 100000

**SAMPLE INPUT:**
6

leolh

rkaech

nhkit

cweit

hiolmtrga

bbaabbaa

**SAMPLE OUTPUT:**

hello

hacker

think

twice

algorithm

aaaabbbb

*_NOTE:_* Consider Time and Space complexity as Major constraint!! :D
