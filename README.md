Staying Idle doesn't give you anything Let's gearup our skills by doing atleast one program daily!! Let's Enjoy moment by finding Multiple ways to depict logic11 :D

## [More Problems](./BONUS/README.md)

True Programmer never delay programming, rather he/she should keep coding as much as possible. So, here I ([@KONA-VENKATA-SAI-LAKSHMI](https://github.com/KONA-VENKATA-SAI-LAKSHMI)) am adding some more problems that you can practise and improve yourcoding skills!! 😃

Credits will be given to the contributor!! :D

#### File Strucure


```
\DAILY CODE BASE
├───BONUS
│   ├───Algorithms
│   ├───Arrays
│   ├───Graphs
│   ├───LinkedLists
│   ├───Queues
│   ├───Recursion
│   ├───Stacks
│   ├───Strings
│   └───Trees
```

In this main `README.md`, there are links to the README of `BONUS` directory, and the `README.md` of sub topics
In the `README.md` of `BONUS` directory, there is the list of all topics and under that there are all questions
In the `README.md` of any topic directory, say `Arrays` there is a README which contains all questions of that topic along with the link to the `README.md` of the directory containing the question
The `README.md` of directory containing the question must contain all the information about the question with some examples and the solution, and a little writeup about the algorithm used.

**Before contributing any question, make sure that this structure is followed properly**

#### NOTE

In case you just want to contribute a question and not code, there is no need to do so many things, just open an issue with the topic **Problem Statement Addon** and the problem in the comments. I'll add it myself, and will give you proper credits 😃

## Practise Problems 😁
